## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Setup Database
Make sure that you have a Postgres database running in your system.
You can define configuration here: `src/database/config/config.json`.
You should modify the `development` part.
Then, execute:
- `npm run migrate` to run migrations and setup database tables
- `npm run seed` to seed the database with dummy data to test the app (optional)

### Run the app
```
npm start
```

### Run tests
```
npm test
```
